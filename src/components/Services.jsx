                        <ul>
                            <li><b>WordPress Website Development: </b> 
                            I specialize in creating websites using the WordPress Content Management System (CMS). Whether you need a personal blog, business website, or an e-commerce platform, I've got you covered.</li>
                            <li><b>Flexible Design Options: </b>  
                            I can work with various Page Builders like <a href="https://elementor.com/" target="_blank">"Elementor"</a> or <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/" target="_blank">"Divi"</a> to bring your vision to life. Alternatively, you can choose a template from <a href="https://themeforest.net/" target="_blank">"Envato Market,"</a> and I'll customize it according to your preferences, incorporating your images, text, and other content.</li>
                            <li><b>Optimized Solutions: </b>
                            For optimal performance and efficiency, I recommend using the <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" target="_blank">Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)</a> plugin and creating a custom theme. This approach ensures that your website is lightweight and tailored exactly to your needs, without unnecessary functionalities.</li>
                            <li><b>Plugin Integration & Management: </b>
                            I integrate and manage a variety of plugins to add diverse functionalities to your website, including <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/" target="_blank">"Contact form"</a>, galleries, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/popup-maker/" target="_blank"></a>"Popup Maker", SEO optimization with <a href="https://yoast.com/" target="_blank">"Yoast SEO"</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/" target="_blank">"UpdraftPlus"</a> backups, caching, and more. While I primarily utilize <b>FREE</b> plugins, in some cases, depending on specific user needs, a <b>PRO</b> plugin may be required. Rest assured, you'll always be informed about any premium plugin usage.</li>
                            <li><b>Custom Design Integration: </b>
                            If you have a specific design or a Figma template in mind, I can build your website from scratch based on those specifications.</li>
                            <li><b>Collaborative Process: </b>
                            To get started, simply provide me hosting and domain. After website installation I'll need necessary materials such as email, logo, images, and text. I'll take care of the rest, keeping you updated throughout the process.</li>
                            <li><b>Efficient Time Tracking: </b>
                            I use the <a href="https://app.clockify.me/tracker" target="_blank">Clockify App</a> to track time accurately for each project. Additionally, I open a new separate project for each client, providing you with access to the project details. This allows you to see the number of tasks completed and the time spent on each one, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the project. You'll also receive a detailed report at the end of each month for further clarity.</li>
                            <li><b>Meeting and Discussion Tracking: </b>
                            All meetings and discussions regarding your website project are tracked as tasks to ensure that every aspect of our collaboration is accounted for and transparent.</li>
                            <li><b>Transparent Pricing: </b>
                            My rate is <b><i>$20 per hour</i></b>, with availability six days a week from <b><i>10:00 to 19:00 (GMT+4)</i></b>. You can trust that you're getting quality work at a fair price.</li>
                            <li><b>Price Estimation Process: </b>
                            To provide you with an accurate price estimation, I'll need some information about the structure of your website, including the number of pages, types of content, desired functionality (which may require plugins or custom code), and any animations or special features you have in mind. Based on this information, I'll give you an approximate range of both time and price for the project. Please note that the actual time and cost may vary depending on the complexity and any changes during the process.</li>
                            <li><b>Convenient Payment Options: </b>I prefer to receive payment at the beginning of each month, giving you peace of mind and ensuring a smooth workflow.</li>
                            <li><b>Comprehensive Support: </b>
                            Once the project is completed, I can offer training sessions or provide documentation with images and videos, empowering you to manage your website independently. Additionally, I offer ongoing support for updates and adding new content as needed.</li>
